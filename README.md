# Google Cloud Serverless Repository

This repository contains code examples and configurations for deploying serverless applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Below, you can find links to specific branches, each showcasing a particular serverless service or framework. Additionally, we provide an overview of the GCP products used, including their advantages, limitations, and recommended use cases.

## Branches and Descriptions

### 1. [App Engine with Node.js & Express](https://github.com/donireives/google-cloud-serverless/tree/appengine-nodejs-express)
#### Overview:
Google App Engine is a fully managed serverless platform for deploying web applications and APIs. This branch demonstrates how to deploy a Node.js application using the Express.js framework on App Engine.

#### Advantages:
- Fully managed with automatic scaling.
- Supports multiple runtime environments (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java).
- Integrated monitoring and logging with Stackdriver.
- Custom domains and HTTPS support.

#### Limitations:
- May require configuration tuning for high-performance workloads.
- Costs can increase with sustained high usage.

#### Use Cases:
- Web applications requiring high availability.
- APIs that benefit from seamless scaling and integrated services.

### 2. [Cloud Functions with Node.js & Express](https://github.com/donireives/google-cloud-serverless/tree/cloudfunction-nodejs-express)
#### Overview:
Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. This branch demonstrates how to deploy an Express.js application using Cloud Functions.

#### Advantages:
- Fully managed and scalable.
- Pay-per-use pricing.
- Ideal for event-driven use cases (e.g., triggers from Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage).

#### Limitations:
- Limited execution time (up to 9 minutes per function).
- Not suitable for applications requiring persistent connections or long-running processes.

#### Use Cases:
- Backend APIs for lightweight applications.
- Event-driven automation (e.g., file processing, notifications).

### 3. [Cloud Run with Node.js & Express](https://github.com/donireives/google-cloud-serverless/tree/cloudrun-nodejs-express)
#### Overview:
Cloud Run is a serverless container platform that automatically scales your containerized applications. This branch demonstrates how to deploy a Node.js application with Express.js on Cloud Run.

#### Advantages:
- Supports any language or library that can run in a container.
- Scales down to zero when idle, saving costs.
- Allows greater flexibility compared to Cloud Functions.

#### Limitations:
- Requires containerization expertise.
- Cold start latency can be noticeable for certain workloads.

#### Use Cases:
- Deploying containerized microservices.
- Running web applications and RESTful APIs.

### 4. [Cloud Run with PHP & Laravel](https://github.com/donireives/google-cloud-serverless/tree/cloudrun-php-laravel)
#### Overview:
This branch illustrates deploying a Laravel application to Cloud Run. Cloud Run provides a versatile and scalable platform for PHP applications.

#### Advantages:
- Same benefits as Cloud Run above.
- Optimized for PHP developers using the Laravel framework.

#### Limitations:
- PHP's synchronous nature may require careful design for high-concurrency use cases.

#### Use Cases:
- Laravel-based web applications or APIs.
- Migrating monolithic Laravel apps to a serverless architecture.

### 5. [Firebase Hosting with Next.js](https://github.com/donireives/google-cloud-serverless/tree/firebase-apphosting-nextjs)
#### Overview:
Firebase Hosting is a fast and secure hosting solution for web applications. This branch shows how to deploy a Next.js application to Firebase Hosting.

#### Advantages:
- Excellent performance for static and dynamic content.
- Integrated with Firebase services (e.g., Firestore, Authentication).
- Simple deployment process.

#### Limitations:
- Best suited for web apps requiring Firebase integration.
- Limited server-side processing capabilities compared to Cloud Run.

#### Use Cases:
- Static and server-rendered Next.js applications.
- Applications leveraging Firebase's real-time database and authentication.

---

### 6. [Firebase Hosting with React.js](https://github.com/donireives/google-cloud-serverless/tree/firebase-hosting-reactjs)
#### Overview:
This branch demonstrates deploying a React.js application on Firebase Hosting, leveraging its seamless integration and optimization for modern web applications.

#### Advantages:
- Similar benefits as Firebase Hosting with Next.js.
- Optimized for React.js workflows.

#### Limitations:
- Same as Firebase Hosting with Next.js.

#### Use Cases:
- React.js SPAs or PWAs requiring Firebase integration.
- Web apps with real-time features.
